# Project State: Monarch Castle Technologies — Market Intelligence

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Investors trust every number and instantly grasp supply-chain structure, concentration, and risk — credibility first, then beauty, then unique depth.

**Current Focus:** Phase 11 — Multi-Hop Scenario Cascade

**Mode:** mvp | **Granularity:** fine

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (carried into v1.1)

- Multi-hop `runScenario` (11-01): engine default `maxHops=1` reproduces the v1.0 single-hop anchor byte-identically; multi-hop is opt-in. Exactly 6 real bridge edges (TSM, TCEHY, ASML, AZN, AMAT, LIN) derived by `buildSelfLabels` via exact `normalizeEntityLabel` matching — no alias map, no fabricated edges. Memo key appends `|h${maxHops}`. Cycle-safety via a visited `hopOf` set (proven by a synthetic 2-cycle fixture), bound via `maxHops`. hop>=2 `lostSuppliers` = the wave/bridge labels that reached the firm (A2). Result gained `hop`/`byHop`/`maxHopReached` (additive superset).
- Real-data-only — NO fabricated weights or sources. Volume-weighted HHI is DEFERRED (HHI-01, blocked-on-real-data): the dataset has no per-supplier volume, so a true HHI cannot be computed without fabricating weights.
- Cascade output stays honestly `Derived` (never Observed); multi-hop assumptions + termination bound documented in Methodology.
- Keep buildless static GitHub-Pages deploy + weekly auto-update Actions pipeline intact.
- Authoritative gate is `npm test` (301 pass / 0 fail at v1.1 start), NOT `node --test tests/`.
- New behavior gets new registered tests; the 301-test suite stays green throughout.

### v1.1 Engineering Context

- `runScenario(disruption, ctx)` in `js/analytics/index.js` is currently SINGLE-HOP (a firm is impacted iff it loses ≥1 distinct supplier; cascade explicitly deferred). It is pure/DOM-free, memoized, and reports `concentrationBefore/After` as HHI=1/k (the monotonic metric, not the composite score). CASC-01 extends this to bounded multi-hop over the real graph.
- The fan-in graph is `buildSupplierFanIn(profiles)` → `Map<normalizedSupplierLabel, Set<symbol>>`; supplier labels are normalized via `normalizeEntityLabel`. Multi-hop traversal must reuse these keys and stay cycle-safe.
- `SCENARIO_PRESETS.TAIWAN_SEMI` bundles 5 real normalized TSMC label variants; single-hop anchor is 7 firms / $11,360,589,871,184. Multi-hop must produce a SUPERSET of this.
- The scenario UI lives in `js/ui/index.js` (renderScenario) + `index.html` `#scenarioPanel` (NEW-IDs-only discipline); the headline is derived live (no 7 / $11.36T literal anywhere — test-enforced). Methodology copy lives in the `#methodologyModal` block.
- 75 dangling source FKs documented in v1.0 Methodology copy. Provenance/source resolution lives in `js/trust` (`provenanceFor`) + `js/data` (`sourceYear`, source-index lookup). INTG-01/02 partial cleanup operates here; INTG-02 must keep unresolved FKs at the Unknown floor.
- `auto-update-data.yml` known non-blocking line-34 timestamp-echo quoting bug (flagged in v1.0 LAUNCH.md, not yet fixed) — INFRA-01 target. Workflow runs Mon 06:00 UTC cron + 3 data-validation tests + commits `data/`.

### Standing Constraints

- 301-test suite (v1.1 baseline) must stay green throughout; new behavior gets new registered tests.
- Real, sourced data only — nothing fabricated; volume-weighted HHI stays DEFERRED.
- `data/` JSON contract and auto-update pipeline must keep working.
- No framework/build tool — preserve buildless static GitHub-Pages deploy.

### Todos

- (none yet)

### Blockers

- (none) — note: local render still does not paint because the committed `data/top100-map.js` snapshot lacks `nodes`/`links`/`profiles` and the sandbox blocks the Google Fonts CDN. Pre-existing data condition; affects local visual-render verification only. True visual check requires a valid production snapshot or the live deploy.

## Session Continuity

**Last action:** Executed Plan 11-01 (multi-hop scenario cascade engine). Extended `runScenario` to a bounded cycle-safe multi-hop BFS (default maxHops:1, v1.0 byte-identical), added exported `buildSelfLabels` (the 6 real bridges), added per-entry `hop` + `byHop` + `maxHopReached`, and keyed the memo on maxHops. Authored + registered `tests/scenario-cascade.test.mjs`. `npm test` = 310 pass / 0 fail (301 baseline + 9 cascade). CASC-01 + CASC-04 complete.

**Next step:** Execute Plan 11-02 (scenario UI hop breakdown + methodology copy) with `/gsd:execute-phase 11`.
