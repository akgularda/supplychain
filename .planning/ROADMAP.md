# Roadmap: Monarch Castle Technologies â "Best in the World"

**Created:** 2026-06-20
**Granularity:** fine
**Mode:** mvp
**Core Value:** Investors trust every number and instantly grasp supply-chain structure, concentration, and risk â credibility first, then beauty, then unique depth.

This roadmap preserves the approved spec's mandatory ordering: **Foundation first â Trust â Storytelling/Visual â Depth of intelligence â Performance/Accessibility/Launch last.** Trust precedes all visual polish (credibility-first hard constraint from the spec risk register).

**Standing hard constraints (apply to every phase):**
- The existing 103-test suite stays green throughout; new behavior gets new tests.
- Real, sourced data only â nothing fabricated; every major figure traceable to a reachable source.
- Buildless static site preserved; GitHub-Pages direct serve and the weekly auto-update Actions pipeline keep working.
- No login; public investor audience.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation (Safety-Net Modularization)** - Extract inline CSS/JS into modules with zero user-visible change, tests green, baseline captured (completed 2026-06-20)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation (Safety-Net Modularization)
**Goal**: The monolithic `index.html` becomes a maintainable, modular foundation with no user-visible change, giving every later phase a safe base to build on.
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: FOUND-01, FOUND-02, FOUND-03, FOUND-04, FOUND-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Inline CSS is extracted into versioned `styles/` files (base/layout/components/theme) with no visual change to the rendered site.
  2. Inline JavaScript is extracted into ES modules under `js/` (data, viz, ui, trust, state) and `index.html` is reduced to a semantic shell linking those files.
  3. The full existing test suite (103 tests) passes unchanged, and the GitHub-Pages static deploy still serves the site directly with no build step.
  4. The site renders byte-for-byte equivalently to today (no user-visible regression).
  5. A performance + Lighthouse baseline is captured and recorded in the repo for later comparison.
**Plans**: 3 plans
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Pre-extraction Lighthouse/perf baseline + tooling (FOUND-04)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Extract CSS + JS modules, semantic-shell index.html, window.* shim (FOUND-01/02/03)
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Deploy workflow copies styles/+js/, post-extraction parity + baseline (FOUND-05/04)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 2: Provenance & Source Linking
**Goal**: No investor sees a major number without knowing whether it is observed or estimated and where it came from â the credibility foundation laid before any other trust feature.
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: TRUST-01, TRUST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every displayed major figure shows a provenance badge tagging it `observed` or `estimated`.
  2. Each figure exposes a reachable inline source link (e.g., SEC filing, annual report) on hover or click that resolves to a real source.
  3. No figure is fabricated or unsourced â provenance is driven by the existing real `data/` JSON contract, which remains unchanged.
  4. The 103-test suite stays green with provenance rendering in place.
**Plans**: 4 plans
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Implement data-driven trust core (provenanceFor/badgeHtml/renderProvenanceBadge) + register provenance test (TRUST-01/02)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Wire badges into viz: node/link tooltips, $cap stat bar, verified-node class (TRUST-01/02)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Wire badges into ui: company card, compare grid, source drawer + fix src.t→title bug (TRUST-01/02)
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Register trust-wiring test, full-suite green gate, browser human-verify checkpoint (TRUST-01/02)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 3: Confidence, Methodology & Freshness
**Goal**: Investors can judge how much to trust each figure and the dataset as a whole â quantified confidence, an explained methodology, and a verifiable freshness guarantee.
**Mode:** mvp
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: TRUST-03, TRUST-04, TRUST-05, TRUST-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A confidence score (0â100%) is computed per figure, weighted by source type and age decay, and shown in tooltips.
  2. A dedicated Methodology view explains data sources, confidence weighting, and known limits.
  3. A visible "last verified / data freshness" indicator is tied to the auto-update pipeline timestamp and stays accurate after a weekly refresh.
  4. New tests cover provenance tagging and confidence-scoring math, and the full suite stays green.
**Plans**: 4 plans
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — [BLOCKING] restore rich served data/top100-map.js, quarantine weekly updater, register Phase-3 tests + data-shape guard (TRUST-05/06)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — confidenceScore in js/trust + sourceYear in js/data + viz tooltip score wiring + remove viz #lastUpdated dup (TRUST-03/05/06)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — accessible Methodology modal + freshness single-owner + methodology/freshness tests (TRUST-04/05/06)
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — full-suite green gate + render smoke + human visual verify (TRUST-03/04/05/06)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 4: Design System & Smooth Motion

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A consistent design system (typography scale, color, depth, motion tokens) is applied site-wide.
  2. D3 transitions are smooth with no jarring full-simulation restart on view changes.
  3. All existing trust affordances (provenance badges, source links, confidence, freshness) remain visible and correct under the new design system.
  4. The 103-test suite plus the trust tests stay green.
**Plans**: 4 plans
Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Token set in base.css :root + register design-tokens & viz-motion tests (STORY-01/03)
